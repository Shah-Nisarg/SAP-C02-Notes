Strategy
-

1. Reading questions first vs answer first
   - Considering length of questions
2. Keywords
3. Eliminate answers
4. Identify optimization area 
   - cost
   - security
   - availability
   - performance

Anti-patterns
-

- Doing things manually or on a case by case basis
- Writing scripts or lambda 
  - when automated solutions are available
- Throwing arbitrary numbers 
  - e.g. use 2000 IOPS when question doesn't provide any numbers to calculate using
- Solutions that require significant changes to application code, architecture or time to implement
